# BEAssignment
REST API for Assignment

## What I Use
* ASP.NET Core 8.0 cause it LTS after 6.0
* SQLite, for lightweight and db are included in the project.
* Docker

## How to Set up
### Visual Studio
To Use Launch on `docker` or `http` to build and run it

### Visual Code
In User-RESTful Folder
* use `dotnet build` and then `dotnet run`
* you can use Swagger at `http://localhost:5018/swagger/index.html`

### Authentication
Use `dotnet user-jwts create` to create a token for authentication in Swagger 
or use it on header when calling APIs

header should be like this
```Authorization: Bearer {token}```
where `{token}` is the previously generated by `dotnet user-jwts create`

more details here: [Manage JSON Web Tokens in development with dotnet user-jwts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/jwt-authn?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=windows)

## About Test
* Use Dapper instead of EFCore because it is lightweight for example project and easier to connect db but loses structure.
* Use JWT to authenticate, did not implement user auth just use simple generate token to simulate auth.
* make all CRUD endpoints.
* Unit Test Repository.
* Async/Await style Repository and Services

## Todo when have more time
* Use EF to structure repository and query with LINQ
* Did not use SQLite and find another Relational DB like Postgres
* implement thread-safe
* CI Docker
