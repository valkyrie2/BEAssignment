# BEAssignment
REST API for Assignment

## What I Use
* ASP.NET Core 8.0
* SQLite, for lightweight db and included in the project.
* Docker

## How to Set up
### Visual Studio
To Use Launch on `docker` or `http` to build and run it

Use `dotnet user-jwts create` to create a token for authentication in Swagger 
or use it on header when calling APIs

header should be like this
```Authorization: Bearer {token}```
where `{token}` is the previously generated by `dotnet user-jwts create`

more details here: [Manage JSON Web Tokens in development with dotnet user-jwts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/jwt-authn?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=windows)

### Visual Code
In User-RESTful Folder
* use `dotnet build`
